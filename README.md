# hu_assesment

For now aasesment run only localy, STILL WITHOUT deployment that I want to do with docker contasiners: 

1)UI
2)Baack_End
3) MongoDB

and it should be running by docker-compose that I'll attach to solution.

But now it runs only localy on pc with pre-installed MongoDB or that can be find by pass: mongodb://localhost:27017. Pass can be chabged in appsettings.json but when I'll finish deployment I'll come from  environment varibles.
First solution from folder Form_Builder should be run, it exposes apis on http//localhost:5050
Then from UI_For_builder run the front end of assesment. For now UI exposed on: http//localhost:3000
